# Starting Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a complex software with many moving components interacting
with each other.

Start the cluster by running the `launch.sh`{{execute}} script.

This will create a Kubernetes cluster made of two nodes, it will take ~2 minutes.

Run the `kubectl get nodes`{{execute}} command a couple of times and look
under the column `STATUS`.

Once you see both nodes marked as `Ready`, move to the next section.
